## Description
Emojis in domain names and URLs are becoming increasingly popular, so I thought it would be fun to be able to include them in your YOURLs short codes.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. `composer install` the dependencies
3. In /user/plugins, create a new folder named yourls-emoji.
4. Move these files into that directory.
5. Go to the Plugins administration page (e.g. https://sho.rt/admin/plugins.php) and activate the plugin.
6. Have fun!
